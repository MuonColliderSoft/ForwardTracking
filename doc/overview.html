<h3>Forward Tracking is the software for track search in the forward direction of the ILD.</h3>

Here is a short description of the folders in the include and src directories:

<dl>


<dt>Analysis</dt>
<dd>
   Processors for analysing some part of an event.
   <dl>
      <dt> TrueTrackCritAnalyser </dt>
      <dd> For analysing the values of the criteria (as used by the Cellular Automaton) when applied to true tracks </dd>

      <dt> OverlapChecker </dt>
      <dd> Very small processor to see what tracks are sharing hits </dd>

      <dt> StepAnalyser </dt>
      <dd> Processor to analyse the path a track takes through the FTD </dd>
   </dl>
</dd>



<dt>Executables</dt>
<dd>
   A bunch of executables for different tasks
   <dl>
      <dt> CritRunner </dt>
      <dt> QuantileAnalyser </dt>
      <dt> worker </dt>
      <dt> worker_time </dt>
   </dl>
</dd>

<dt>ForwardTracking</dt>
<dd>
   Standallone track reconstruction of tracks in the FTD
   <dl>
      <dt> ForwardTracking00 </dt>
      <dd> Reconstructs tracks for the old representation of the FTD ( v00 in Mokka ) </dd>

      <dt> ForwardTracking </dt>
      <dd> Reconstructs tracks for the current representation of the FTD ( currently v02 in Mokka ) </dd>
   </dl>
</dd>

<dt>FTDNoise</dt>
<dd>
   Processors to add artificial background on the FTD to simulate more accurate events
   <dl>
      <dt> FTDBackgroundProcessor00 <dt/>
      <dd> Simulates background for the old representation of the FTD (v00 in Mokka). </dd>

      <dt> FTDBackgroundProcessor01 </dt>
      <dd> Simulates background for the current representation of the FTD ( currently v02 in Mokka ) </dd>

      <dt> FTDGhostProcessor </dt>
      <dd> Simulates ghost hits for the v01-Mokka FTD version. As meanwhile ghosthits are created automatically by the SpacePoint processors, not needed anymore </dd>
   </dl>
</dd>


<dt>rootscripts</dt>
<dd>
   Some root scripts used to work with analysis data in root files.
   Most of it is hardcoded.
</dd>

<dt>TrackingFeedback</dt>
<dd>
   Feedback about the track reconstruction quality
   <dl>
      <dt> TrackingFeedbackProcessor </dt>
      <dd> Gives feedback about the quality of track reconstruction </dd>

      <dt> TrueTrack </dt>
      <dd> A class to help the TrackingFeedbackProcessor </dd>
   </dl>
</dd>

<dt>TrackPicker</dt>
<dd>
   <dl>
      <dt> TrackPickProcessor </dt>
      <dd> A small processor to pick single tracks or a group from some basic tracks and stores them in as a collection.
      Pretty much hardcoded and only used for debugging so far, so beware. </dd>
   </dl>
</dd>

</dl>

    A good idea to read this before the class documentation of the Cellular Automaton
