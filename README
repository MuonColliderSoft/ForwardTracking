Version History
=============================================================================================================
 

  -----------------------------
 | changes since last version  |
  -----------------------------

      - TrackingFeedbackProcessor: made the minimum rate of true hits in reco track steerable

  ---------
 | v01-05  |
  ---------

      - ForwardTracking: more debug output statements
      - TrueTrackCritAnalyser: Adapted to changed hit order in Segments
      - TrackingFeedbackProcessor: Added the event number and the sum of tracks belonging to a true track to the root file.
      - TrackingFeedbackProcessor: 
         + Added output of theta and nHits of true tracks to root output (so one can plot efficiency over theta or nHits)
         + Added output of mcp vertex position to root file
      - ForwardTracking: 
         + Added a HelixFit before the Kalman Fit to increase the speed
         + Nested the CA inside a while loop, repeating it with tightened cut until not too many connections are made.
            Also added the steering parameters for that
      - TrueTrackCritAnalyser: Added saving of chi2, Ndf and chi2/Ndf from helix fit to root file

  ---------
 | v01-04  |
  ---------
 
      - ForwardTracking: As FTDTrack now only takes IFTDHit pointers, the passed arguments are changed
      - Added FTDBackgroundProcessor which adds salt and pepper background to the FTD TrackerHit collections
      - Erased the executables worker and worker_time as they were outdated
      - Added executable param_runner, to rerun Marlin several times while altering a steering parameter
      - Added executable param_runner_background a version of param_runner specialised for the FTDBackgroundProcessor
      - TrueTrackCritAnalyser: 
         + no more fitting is done, tracks are assumed to be already fitted 
         + chi2prob is now stored for the criteria branches as well
      - wrote overview for the doxygen
      - switched to new subset classes (SubsetHopfieldNN and SubsetSimple)
      - TrueTrackCritAnalyser:
         + added output of the distances of 2 hits in the tracks
         + renamed the cut steer parameters to start with Cut
         + added doxygen documentation
      - TrackingFeedback:
         + added new class RecoTrack and reworked TrueTrack as well
            (now every true track gets a TrueTrack object and every reconstructed track gets a RecoTrack object.
            In the checking they are then linked: RecoTracks now their assigned TrueTracks and vice versa )
         + added output to a root file
         + renamed the cut steer parameters to start with Cut
         + added doxygen documentation
      - Added the folder rootscripts containing the root scripts I use to make graphs

  ---------
 | v01-03  |
  ---------

      - Splitted ForwardTracking into 3: 
         + the core is now in the package KiTrack
         + an implementation of the ABCs in the core is in the package KiTrackMarlin
         + and ForwardTracking now contains all the processors 
         
         This means: 
            ~ The folder FTrack got renamed to KiTrack and is now in the package KiTrack
            ~ The folder Criteria is now in KiTrack as well
            ~ The folder ILDImpl is now in KiTrackMarlin
            ~ The folder Tools is now in KiTrackMarlin
            ~ Each package has now its namespace: "KiTrack" and "KiTrackMarlin"
         
         
  ---------
 | v01-02  |
  ---------

      - added finalising of tracks (final refit, radius of innermost hit, hitnumbers of detectors,... see method ForwardTracking::finaliseTrack )
      - modified fitting: now done in one central place by the class Fitter
      - changed initialisation of FTDTrack: now a MarlinTrkSystem* has to be passed, which can be used by the track to fit
      - Modified to use spacepoints
      - Added steering parameter: TakeBestVersionOfTrack
      - Added steering parameter for the best track subset
      - Use new gear params for FTD (getNSensors)
      - patched memory leaks
      - some renaming of classes and documentation


  -----------
 | v01-01-01 |
  -----------


      - lengthenSegments() modified to be able to deal with 0 hits situation
      - Made an ITrackSubset Interface and added TrackSubsetSimple
      - Added new executable to run Marlin (worker.cc) with different backgrounds
      - Added a regulator for all the background (FTDBackgroundProcessor) to easily make it stronger or weaker with just one parameter
      - Rewrote the TrackingFeedbackProcessor. Changed the MyRelation struct to a class called TrueTrack and modified it. 
      - Added the Fitter class, which is just a class that fits some hits or a track and returns chi2, chi2prob and Ndf.
      - Made the hit connector more specific and thus track finding faster. 
      - Corrected error in FTDHit01 with the setting of the layer. 
      - Added more info to StepAnalyser
